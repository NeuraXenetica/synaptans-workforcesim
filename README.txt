OVERVIEW OF THE SOFTWARE
░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

THANK YOU for your interest in Synaptans WorkforceSim™, version 0.1.081!

This software has been developed for educational and research-related purposes by NeuraXenetica LLC and is distributed free of charge. It creates a virtual population of simulated factory employees with diverse personal characteristics and abilities and then simulates their daily workplace behaviors and job performance through a specified number of days. Users are able to adjust the values of arguments including the number of persons employed in the factory; the number of days of activity to simulate; the minimum and maximum age of workers; and the mean value and standard deviation for employees’ characteristics such as their attendance rate, industriousness, eagerness and ability to learn, ability to teach others, degree of conscientiousness, ability to inspire and lead others, positivity of attitude, and degree of supportiveness displayed toward their fellow workers. Once such arguments have been specified, the software generates a quasi-randomized virtual workforce possessing such characteristics; simulates the activity of the virtual workforce during the desired period; and then presents the results through a series of visualizations. 

By building such a model of a simulated factory workforce, it becomes possible to manipulate variables, test hypotheses, and explore causal relationships in a way that isn’t feasible or desirable with real human beings in a real-world factory setting. For example, the software can facilitate investigation of the kinds of organizational elements, psychological factors, and interpersonal dynamics that have an influence on the motivation, satisfaction, and job performance of employees in a factory setting. A user can also examine the manner in which changes to a virtual workforce’s size and to the psychological characteristics of individual employees impact the structure and performance of larger organizational units such as production teams and entire shifts. The software also makes it possible, for example, to investigate the extent to which variations in the performance of different managers’ teams or shifts may result from random differences in their subordinates’ personal characteristics, rather than from differences in the managers’ own managerial abilities.

STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS 
OF THE SIMULATED WORKFORCE 
░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

-----------------------------------------------
ORGANIZATIONAL ROLES
-----------------------------------------------

The simulated workforce comprises a group of employees organized into four hierarchical levels, as described below:

▶ Production Director. Regardless of how many employees it has, the simulated factory possesses a single Production Director who bears overall responsibility for all aspects of production operations. The Production Director has no supervisor (within the context of the simulation), no peers, and three direct subordinates (i.e., the Shift Managers). The Production Director can be understood as the employee situated at the “top” of the organizational hierarchy.

▶ Shift Managers. The simulated factory has three Shift Managers, each of whom oversees one of the factory’s successive daily shifts. Each Shift Manager reports directly to the Production Director, has the other two Shift Managers as peers, and serves as the supervisor of eight Team Leaders.

▶ Team Leaders. Each shift has eight Team Leaders, each of whom oversees a team of one or more Laborers. Each Team Leader reports directly to the Shift Manager of the relevant shift, has the other seven Team Leaders of the same shift as peers, and serves as the supervisor of one or more Laborers.

▶ Laborers. The factory has a variable number of specialized Laborers, with the exact number depending on input provided by a user. Each Laborer reports directly to the relevant Team Leader, does not supervise any other persons, and has a variable number of fellow team-member Laborers as peers (depending on the size of the workforce specified by the user).

-----------------------------------------------
ASSIGNING RANDOMIZED PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS 
-----------------------------------------------

Each person in the simulated workforce possesses a number of characteristics that are generated by the simulator in a manner that is quasi-randomized, as guided by certain parameters established by the software’s user. (The way in which such characteristics are generated and their relationship to user-supplied arguments is explained in more detail later in this document.) We can divide such personal characteristics into “demographic traits” and “core stats,” as discussed below.

DEMOGRAPHIC TRAITS

▶ “AGE” is a person’s age in years at the start of the simulated time period; it is randomly generated to fall between the minimum and maximum ages specified by the user.

▶ “SEX” is a person’s sex; in this version of the software, a person is randomly assigned either “M” or “F” as a sex.

CORE STATS 

A person’s core stats are numbers that reflect the degree to which the individual possesses or manifests particular abilities or behaviors. The value of each core stat is independently generated for each person in the simulated workforce. The values of these stats are randomly generated to fall between 0.0 and 1.0, using a mean value and standard deviation specified by the user. In general, core stats are constructed in such a way that a high value is “better” than a low value. (E.g., there is a stat for one’s rate of attendance, rather than one’s rate of absence.)

▶ “ATD” reflects a person’s daily base rate of attendance on those days when he or she is scheduled to work. It is, in many ways, an employee’s most fundamental core stat: if an employee isn’t able to successfully reach the workplace, then his or her other stats will not be particularly relevant. There is a wide range of imaginable reasons why a particular employee might have a low ATD stat; for example, he or she might suffer from a chronic illness, might need to care for a family member who has a chronic illness, might live at a great distance from the factory and have a lack of reliable transportation, or might be irresponsible or disengaged from his or her job.

▶ “DEX” reflects a person’s base rate of physical dexterity, which is important for a factory’s frontline employees who manipulate complex machinery, perform fine motor tasks, manually transport items, or operate in moving or unsteady environments as part of their work.

▶ “IND” reflects an employee’s industriousness – i.e., how hard he or she works during the times when the individual is present for work. An employee with a high IND stat will, on average, produce more per shift than one with a low IND stat. Note that it is possible for a person to have a very high rate of productivity but rarely be present for work, or vice versa.

▶ “INS” captures a person’s ability to inspire and lead others. Having a high INS stat is not critical for frontline Laborers, but it is important for the successful managerial performance of Team Leaders, Shift Managers, and the Production Director.

▶ “INT” reflects a person’s overall level of intelligence, which can be understood here as the general ability to gather meaningful data and recognize its significance; identify relevant trends and causal connections; anticipate the outcomes of future actions; and solve problems.

▶ “LRN” reflects a person’s degree of eagerness and ability to learn (e.g., learning how to operate a new type of machine or perform a new kind of complex task).

▶ “ORD” reflects a person’s degree of inherent orderliness and self-organization.

▶ “POL” reflects a person’s degree of political sensitivity and diplomacy; a high POL stat enables an individual to more effectively navigate the complex social environment that is the workplace.

▶ “POS” reflects the degree of positivity, optimism, and cheerfulness shown by a person in his or her general attitude, interactions with others, and encounters with difficult workplace problems.

▶ “RCN” reflects a person’s degree of patience, empathy, and ability to reduce tensions and bring about reconciliation between persons. Someone with a high RCN stat is able to handle the inevitable stresses and vicissitudes of a factory workplace over the long-term, without bearing destructive grudges or seeking to sabotage or exact “vengeance” on others.

▶ “RSP” reflects a person’s degree of conscientiousness and sense of responsibility. If persons with a high RSP stat notice (for example) recurring product defects, equipment faults, or inefficiencies in processes, they will not simply ignore them; they will proactively bring the problems to the attention of their supervisors or attempt to solve them themselves. They also devote an equally high degree of attention and energy to their work at all times, regardless of whether or not their supervisor is closely monitoring their activities in a given moment.

▶ “SPD” reflects the characteristic speed and efficiency with which a person carries out his or her assigned tasks.

▶ “SPT” reflects the degree to which a person naturally supports, encourages, and assists others in the workplace. It is important for frontline employees who regularly operate in teams and who must collaborate in performing production tasks.

▶ “TCH” reflects a person’s desire and ability to teach others in the workplace. It is manifested, for example, in a veteran Laborer’s willingness to informally mentor and train newly hired Laborers.

RELATIONSHIP OF CORE STATS TO DAILY ACTIVITIES

A complex relationship exists between a person’s personal characteristics and the behaviors that he or she performs daily in the workplace. For example, in general, a person with a higher ATD stat number will show up for work more often than one with a low ATD stat number; however, it is not necessarily the case that someone with an ATD score of (for example) 0.85 will, over the long run, show up for work roughly 85% of the time – as the ultimate probability can be modified by other factors (including the “level of difficulty” assigned to the task of showing up for work).

-----------------------------------------------
COMPOSITE CAPACITY SCORES
-----------------------------------------------

In addition to randomly generating the values of the “raw” core stats possessed by each person in the workforce, the simulator also calculates the values of certain composite capacity scores that present a more generalized, synthetic overview of some aspect of an employee’s potential.

▶ A person’s “worker capacity score” (WRKR_CAP) is a calculated score that attempts to capture his or her general long-term ability to successfully carry out routine frontline production work within the factory (e.g., operating some machine on an assembly line or transporting materials within the factory). It is a weighted average of multiple core stats (including ATD, IND, LRN, and RSP), with more weight being given to a person’s ATD stat. (This reflects the fact that attendance is the most basic prerequisite for being able to carry out work: as noted above, if someone is not able to present in the workplace, then none of his or her other strengths or weaknesses will be relevant.) 

▶ A person’s “managerial capacity score” (MNGR_CAP) is a calculated score designed to reflect his or her general long-term ability to fill a managerial role (e.g., as Team Leader, Shift Manager, or Production Director) within the factory. It is a weighted average of multiple core stats (including ATD, INS, ORD, POL, POS, and RSP), with more weight being given to a person’s ATD stat.

RELATIONSHIP OF WRKR_CAP AND MNGR_CAP SCORES

While, for example, manual dexterity is fairly important for a frontline factory worker and leadership skills are not as essential, the opposite is true for a manager. Such distinctions are reflected in the manner in which the WRKR_CAP and MNGR_CAP scores are calculated: there is some overlap in constituent factors (e.g., ATD contributes significantly to both scores), but other factors contribute to only one of the two scores. It is thus possible for a worker to have a relatively high WRKR_CAP score but a low MNGR_CAP score, or vice versa. This reflects the real-world fact that the skills needed to successfully perform frontline work in a given organization may differ significantly from the skills needed to successfully oversee *other* persons who are performing such work. Someone who is an excellent frontline worker may or may not thrive when promoted into a managerial position, while someone who struggles in a frontline position might excel when asked to supervise others who are performing such work.

-----------------------------------------------
ASSIGNING ROLES WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION
-----------------------------------------------

The simulated factory is designed to model a real-world organization. In real-world competitive contexts, running a factory with hundreds or thousands of workers is an incredibly complex undertaking, and (in the absence of nepotism, corruption, incompetence, or neglect on the part of an organization’s board or directors), one may generally presume that the persons who have been assigned to senior management roles have been selected to bear such responsibility because they are well-trained, highly qualified, and have proven (and honed) their managerial abilities through years of experience. The software models this dynamic in the following manner:

▶ From among all persons in the pool of employees, the one individual with the highest MNGR_CAP score is algorithmically assigned to the role of Production Director.

▶ The individuals with the three next-highest MNGR_CAP scores are then algorithmically assigned to roles as the Shift Managers.

▶ All of the remaining individuals within the organization are randomly assigned to the role of either Team Leader or Laborer – without regard to their particular MNGR_CAP or WRKR_CAP scores. This reflects the fact that when new employees join a production company in an entry-level position, it is often not immediately apparent which individuals possess exactly which strengths and weaknesses, and which of them would thrive (or struggle) if they were promoted to the position of Team Leader. The persons assigned to serve as Team Leaders thus may or may not actually be the persons who are theoretically best-qualified to fill such roles.

INSTALLING AND RUNNING THE SOFTWARE
░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

This version of the software is distributed in the form of a single Windows executable file, “Synaptans_WorkforceSim_v_0.1.81.exe”. The software can be run by copying it onto the hard drive or other storage device of a Windows PC and double-clicking on the file name or icon. If the software is capable of running on the given computer, a console window should then open; depending on the capacities of one’s computer, this screen may remain blank (displaying only a blinking cursor) for some moments, while the program loads and initializes itself. A message should eventually appear stating that “Matplotlib is building the font cache; this may take a moment.”

After some additional time, a second window (the main interface window) should open on one’s screen, and the original console window should display a message stating “Welcome to Synaptans WorkforceSim™! Please use the main interface window (which should open separately) to configure and run the simulation.” The main interface window opens with default dimensions of 1200×700 pixels; its size can be adjusted (within certain limits) by manually clicking and dragging its edges or by clicking the icons near the upper right corner to “Maximize” or “Restore Down” the window.

One can terminate the main interface window by pressing “Escape” or clicking on the “X” in its upper right corner. If one closes the main interface window first, the console window will then need to be closed separately; if one closes the console window by pressing on the “X” in its upper right corner, the console window and main interface window should both be terminated.

The program is not guaranteed to run successfully on all devices or with all versions of Windows. The software is distributed “as is” and with no warranties of any kind, whether express or implied; you assume all risk of using the software. (Please see the accompanying “End-User License Agreement.txt” file for more details.)

THE OPERATIONS SCREEN
░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

If you accept the license terms presented in the main interface window’s initial screen, you can click on the button labelled “Click to accept End-User License Agreement and continue” to load the program’s operations screen. The operations screen is the place where a user can specify the parameters for the simulation, click to run the simulation, and then view visualizations of the results.

-----------------------------------------------
SPECIFYING THE ARGUMENTS FOR A SIMULATION
-----------------------------------------------

There are a number of arguments whose values can be specified by a user, prior to running the simulation. By default, when the operations screen appears, values are already provided for all of these variables; a value can be changed by selecting or deleting it and typing a different number in that box. The significance of these variables is explained below.

▶ The box labelled “Minimum age for an individual” accepts an integer as its value; the default value is 20 and permissible values range from 16-99. Each member of the simulated workforce will have a randomly assigned age that is (on the first day of simulated activity) greater than or equal to the specified number.

▶ The box labelled “Maximum age for an individual” accepts an integer as its value; the default value is 65 and permissible values range from 40-100. Each member of the simulated workforce will have a randomly assigned age that is (on the first day of simulated activity) less than or equal to the specified number.

▶ The box labelled “Desired number of personnel” accepts an integer as its value; the default value is 724 persons. This number represents the size of the workforce desired by a user; however, the actual size of the workforce used in the simulation may differ somewhat from the number inputted here. This is due to several factors. First, the minimum size of a workforce that can be handled by the simulation is 52 persons; any inputted figure smaller than 52 will thus be rounded up to 52 by the system. Second, the maximum size of a workforce that can be processed by the simulation is 4996 persons; any inputted figure larger than 4996 will thus be rounded down to 4996 by the system. Third, the current version of the software requires each Team Leader to supervise an equal number of Laborers, and because the factory has 24 Team Leaders, this means that the total number of Laborers must be evenly divisible by 24; added to that will be 4 more persons, in the form of the three Shift Managers and one Production Director. The number inputted by the user will thus be rounded to a figure equalling (24n + 4), where n is an integer. (724 is an example of such a number; others are 100, 964, and 4996.)

▶ The box labelled “Mean value for ATD stat” accepts a floating-point number as its value; the default value is 0.91, and permissible values range from 0.0-1.0. This number is used to randomly generate an average attendance rate (“ATD”) for each person in the workforce. The number inputted here is the mean used by the random-number generator, in conjunction with the box beneath it labelled “Standard deviation for ATD stat,” which is the standard deviation used by the random-number generator and is a floating-point number with a default value of 0.09; permissible values are between 0.0 and 1.0. Note that the “Mean value for ATD stat” entered by a user may not be the actual average value of the ATD stat that is ultimately possessed by members of the virtual workforce. This might become apparent, for example, if the “Mean value for ATD stat” is set at a value close to 1.0 (say, 0.98) and the “Standard deviation for ATD stat” is relatively large (say, 0.4). In this case, the random-number generator will produce a number greater than 1.0 for many persons; however, an individual’s rate of attendance cannot be greater than 1.0, so many persons’ ATD stats will be adjusted downward by the system to a value of 1.0.

▶ The boxes labelled “Mean value for other stats” and “Standard deviation for other stats” function similarly. They both accept floating-point numbers, with permissible values ranging from 0.0-1.0. The former has a default value of 0.73 and the later a default value of 0.17. The fact that the default mean value for other stats is lower than the default mean value for the ATD stat reflects the reality that factory workers may viably possess personal psychological characteristics and capacities that span a wide range of strengths and weaknesses; for example, one employee may possess a degree of extroversion, positivity, technological aptitude, honesty, or conscientiousness that greatly exceeds (or falls short of) that of another employee. However, workers whose average long-term attendance rate falls below a certain point will typically not be able to remain a part of the workforce.

▶ The box labelled “Random seed A” accepts an integer as its value; the default value is 11. This number is used as a seed for some of the simulator’s random number generators; allowing a user to specify the seed’s value makes it easier to investigate the varying range of results that can be obtained when all of the other arguments are left with their original values but the randomizing components of the simulator generate different random numbers.

▶ The box labelled “Number of days to simulate” accepts an integer as its value; the default value is 30, and permissible values range from 1-200. This is the number of days of simulated workplace activity that should be calculated by the program. This version of the software does not model any dynamics relating, for example, to differences in average productivity displayed by workers on different days of the week, nor does it distinguish between weekdays and weekends. If one runs the simulation for 10 days, one could conceptualize that either as two weeks of five working days each, or as a single span of 10 contiguous days; this version of the software does not distinguish between the two realities.

-----------------------------------------------
RUNNING THE SIMULATION
-----------------------------------------------

Once a user is satisfied with the values of all the arguments to be used by the model, the simulation can be run by clicking on the button labelled “Click to run the simulation!” 

If the button remains visibly depressed after clicking on it and releasing the mouse button, this indicates that the program has begun the simulation’s calculations, which may require some time (especially if the size of the workforce and number of days to be simulated are large).

On the other hand, if (a) the button does not remain depressed but instead returns to its initial state when the mouse button is released and (b) new visualizations have not appeared in the lower section of the operations screen, this indicates that one or more of the values provided in the input boxes at the top of the operations screen are invalid, and the simulation is not able to perform any calculations. In this case, a user should carefully review the contents of the input boxes (e.g., to be sure that fields requiring numbers as input do not include any letters and that fields requiring integers as input do not include floating-point numbers) and try again.

If the program made any adjustments to the raw values inputted by a user when running the simulation, the final values that were actually used by the simulation will appear in the input boxes at the top of the operations screen after processing of the simulation has concluded and its visualizations have been generated. This may occur, for example, if the value provided by a user for “Desired number of personnel” or “Number of days to simulate” exceeded the maximum value permitted by the simulation or the “Desired number of personnel” was rounded off to a figure usable by the simulation.

Once the simulator has finished calculating the workforce’s activity using the specified arguments, the console window will display a message stating “Simulation results have been calculated.”, and a set of visualizations should appear shortly in the main interface window, in the results section at the bottom of the operations screen. The console will display a similar “Simulation results have been calculated.” message (and the visualizations will be updated) each time the simulation is re-run with new workforce configuration arguments.

CONTENTS OF A SIMULATED DAY IN THE WORKPLACE

In addition to calculating certain static elements (e.g., workers’ core stats and role in the organizational hierarchy) once at the start of a simulation, the simulator also dynamically models certain activities on the part of persons that vary from day to day throughout the simulated period. 

▶ A person’s “Efficacy” is his or her degree of productivity on a given day, as measured against the maximum degree of productivity that could reasonably be expected from a person filling a given role. For a given worker on a given day, his or her Efficacy score is a weighted average of the person’s IND, SPD, and RSP stats, as adjusted by a randomly generated positive or negative number. Over the long run, a person with high IND, SPD, and RSP stats will have a higher average Efficacy than a person with low IND, SPD, and RSP stats; however, there may be particular days on which the latter’s Efficacy exceeds that of the former. When using the simulator’s default arguments, it might be expected that the average Efficacy displayed by all persons across entire simulated period will be somewhere in the range of 0.8-0.9. It is not possible for a person’s daily Efficacy score to be less than 0.0; it is possible (though typically unlikely) for it to be greater than 1.0. It should be noted that Efficacy is a generic productivity score that is applicable to all persons, regardless of their roles: the simulator calculates daily Efficacy scores for the factory’s Production Director and Shift Managers, as well as for its Team Leaders and Laborers – although the exact meaning of such “Efficacy” would vary, depending on a person’s role.

▶ For every day during the simulated period, every person displays a particular level of Efficacy. In addition to that, there are certain noteworthy positive or negative behaviors that persons may display on occasion, but not every day (or even frequently). Such qualitatively remarkable actions cannot easily be captured in the strictly quantitative Efficacy score, thus they are modelled separately. A “Good” behavior is such an exceptional positive action performed by a person, while a “Poor” behavior is such an exceptional negative action. The question of whether a particular person performs a Good or Poor action (or both) on a given day is determined by the simulator separately from the question of whether he or she displayed a high or low degree of Efficacy on that day. It is possible for a person to perform a Good action on a day on which he or she had a low Efficacy, or to perform a Poor action on a day on which he or she had a high Efficacy. As hypothetical examples of Good actions, one might imagine a Laborer who takes time to help or tutor a teammate who is struggling with some task, a Team Leader who develops some ingenious way of reducing the number of faults generated by particular machine, or a Shift Manager who gives an especially inspiring speech that strengthens’ Laborers sense of enthusiasm and engagement. Conversely, hypothetical Poor actions might include a Laborer who causes an accident by ignoring safety rules, a Team Leader who unleashes an angry outburst that depresses Laborers’ morale, or a Shift Manager who engages in some obvious act of favoritism or dishonesty that weakens Laborers’ motivation and sense of engagement. A given person performs a Good behavior on a particular day if the weighted average of multiple relevant core stats (including RCN, RSP, SPT, and TCH) is *greater than* or equal to a threshold value plus some randomly generated positive number; he or she performs a Poor behavior if the weighted average of multiple relevant core stats (including ORD, POS, and RSP) is *less than* or equal to a threshold value plus some randomly generated positive number. (It is anticipated that in future versions of the software, the simulator will be able to generate period Good and Poor behaviors on the basis of persons possessing a low score in just a single core stat.) It is possible for a person to perform a Good and a Poor behavior on the same day. 

-----------------------------------------------
VIEWING THE RESULTS OF A SIMULATION
-----------------------------------------------

Once the program has calculated each person’s activities for all days of the period simulated, it will generate a number of figures that visualize various aspects of the results. In particular:

▶ The figure labelled “Distribution of value of persons’ worker capacity (WRKR_CAP) score” is a histogram showing how many of the factory’s personnel have a worker capacity score that falls within a particular range. In general, the more persons the workforce includes, the smoother the distribution curve will be.

▶ The figure labelled “Distribution of value of persons’ managerial capacity (MNGR_CAP) score” is a histogram showing how many persons have a managerial capacity score that falls within a particular range.

▶ The figure labelled “Values of each person’s WRKR_CAP and MNGR_CAP scores” is a scatter plot illustrating the relationship between persons’ worker capacity scores (on the x-axis) and managerial capacity scores (on the y-axis).

▶ The figure labelled “Values of each person’s age and MNGR_CAP score” is a scatter plot presenting the relationship between persons’ age and their managerial capacity score.

▶ The figure labelled “Average value of persons’ WRKR_CAP scores by shift” is a column graph showing the average value of the worker capacity scores possessed by members (i.e., Laborers, Team Leaders, and Shift Managers) of each of the three shifts. The column labelled “unassigned” reflects the worker capacity scores of the factory’s Production Director, who is not assigned to any particular shift.

▶ The figure labelled “Average value of persons’ MNGR_CAP scores by role filled” is a column graph presenting the average value of the worker capacity scores possessed by persons filling different roles within the factory. (Because there is only one Production Director, the “average” value displayed in the “Production Director” column is equal to that person’s managerial capacity score.)

▶ The figure labelled “Average value of persons’ WRKR_CAP scores by team” is a column graph illustrating the average worker capacity score possessed by members of each of the 24 Teams. The column labelled “unassigned” reflects the worker capacity scores of the factory’s Production Director and Shift Managers, who are not assigned to any particular team.

▶ The figure labelled “Values of each person’s WRKR_CAP scores and mean daily Efficacy” is a scatter plot presenting the relationship between persons’ worker capacity score and their mean daily  Efficacy.

▶ The figure labelled “Number of persons’ Good and Poor workplace actions performed” is a two-dimensional histogram showing how many persons performed quantities of Good and Poor workplace actions that fall within particular numerical ranges. In general, the larger the number of persons included in the virtual workforce and the longer the simulated period of time, the smoother the histogram will appear.
