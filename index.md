## Synaptans WorkforceSim™, version 0.1.082

Synaptans WorkforceSim™ is an open-source platform for simulating the dynamics of a factory workforce and assessing various AI-based approaches to predictive analytics in the workplace. The program exists as a Python package that uses Tkinter to launch a GUI in which users can configure the simulation’s parameters, run the simulation, and view an array of charts and graphs that visualize the results. The simulation is intended to operate at four levels:

▶ LEVEL 1: “WORKERS’ BEHAVIORS.” Here the software simulates the concrete actions performed by frontline factory workers each day (e.g., by determining the actual degree of efficiency with with each worker operates a production machine on a given day and determining exactly when workers cause workplace accidents – or devise and implement business-process improvements – of a given type).

▶ LEVEL 2: “MANAGERS’ RECORDS.” Here the software simulates the behavior of such workers’ immediate managers in noticing (or overlooking) and accurately (or inaccurately) recording workers’ actions in an HRM system, ERP system, or other enterprise system that seeks to document workers’ performance.

▶ LEVEL 3: “AI-BASED ANALYSIS.” Here the software employs various forms of machine learning and AI to attempt to identify trends and causal connections, classify workers, and predict workers’ future behaviors on the basis of the information recorded by managers in the organization’s enterprise system at Level 2. Just as in a real workplace, AI doesn’t have direct access to the sum of workers’ actual behaviors; it can only access, analyze, and draw conclusions on the basis of the data that have actually been recorded in an organization’s information systems – and depending on the degree of competence, honesty, and dedication displayed by managers, such data may or may not accurately reflect the reality of workers’ actual behaviors.

▶ LEVEL 4: “ASSESSEMENT OF THE AI-BASED ANALYSIS.” In a real-world organization, it’s incredibly difficult to gauge the accuracy of AI-generated analysis of workers’ behaviors, as data scientists and senior executives have no access to what’s actually happening at Level 1; they only have access to the relatively tiny quantity of worker behaviors that are captured (often fragmentarily and inaccurately) by information systems at Level 2. The great advantage of a workforce simulation like this one is that we actually know the reality of each worker’s personality, capacities, and daily behaviors – because we have directly specified all of a workers’ characteristics (including attitudes, strengths, and weaknesses that are normally invisible in a workplace setting) and algorithmically determined exactly what actions he or she performs each day. This makes it possible to compare AI-based analysis not only against the observations that managers recorded at Level 2 but against the actual behaviors performed by workers at Level 1. In this way, it becomes possible to evaluate which AI-based approaches can most accurately model workplace behaviors and what degree of confidence can be placed in various forms of predictive analytics.

In the current version of the program, the code for Level 1 has been partially implemented and a development roadmap has been prepared for Levels 2-4.
